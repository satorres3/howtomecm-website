# Story: Blog Post Creation

## Status
- **Current Status**: Not Implemented
- **Story ID**: unknown.blog-post-creation
- **Epic**: Content Management
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimation**: TBD

## Story

**As a** content creator/administrator
**I want to** create and publish blog posts through a user-friendly interface
**So that** I can regularly publish Microsoft endpoint management content without requiring developer intervention

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] Content creation interface (admin panel, markdown editor, or CMS)
- [ ] Post metadata management (title, excerpt, featured image, tags, categories)
- [ ] Content authoring with rich text or markdown support
- [ ] Draft and publish workflow
- [ ] SEO metadata management
- [ ] Image upload and management

### Should Have
- [ ] Content preview functionality
- [ ] Scheduled publishing
- [ ] Content revision history
- [ ] Category and tag management
- [ ] Author management
- [ ] Content search and filtering in admin

### Could Have
- [ ] Content approval workflow
- [ ] Bulk content operations
- [ ] Content analytics and metrics
- [ ] Integration with external content sources

## Tasks/Subtasks

### Technical Implementation
- [ ] Choose content management approach (CMS, file-based, hybrid)
- [ ] Implement database layer (currently stubbed)
- [ ] Create content creation interface
- [ ] Implement media file management
- [ ] Add authentication and authorization
- [ ] Integrate content creation with existing display system

### Content Strategy
- [ ] Define content authoring workflow
- [ ] Set up content templates and guidelines
- [ ] Configure SEO and metadata standards
- [ ] Plan content migration from demo to real content

## Technical Notes

### Current State Analysis
- **Blog Display**: ✅ Fully implemented with modern React components
- **Content System**: ✅ Hybrid architecture ready for CMS integration
- **Database**: ❌ Completely stubbed out for static export
- **Security**: ✅ DOMPurify sanitization and CSP headers implemented
- **Performance**: ✅ Optimized with bundle analysis and Web Vitals

### Architecture Considerations
- System designed for both static export and dynamic CMS
- Content.ts library already built with CMS integration patterns
- Database abstraction layer exists but needs implementation
- Type definitions comprehensive and production-ready

### Content Management Options
1. **Static/File-based**: Markdown files in git repository
2. **Headless CMS**: Supabase, Strapi, or similar
3. **Hybrid**: Static generation with CMS content source

## Testing

### Test Coverage Needed
- [ ] Content creation workflow tests
- [ ] Content validation and sanitization
- [ ] Publishing workflow tests
- [ ] Media upload and management tests
- [ ] Integration tests for content display

### Security Testing
- [ ] Input sanitization validation
- [ ] File upload security
- [ ] Authentication and authorization
- [ ] XSS and injection prevention

## Dev Notes

### Implementation Priority
Based on brownfield architecture analysis, recommend hybrid approach:
1. Week 1: Implement markdown-based content system
2. Future: Upgrade to full CMS when content volume grows

### Dependencies
- Database implementation decision (Supabase recommended)
- Authentication system selection
- Admin interface framework choice

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

**Analysis Summary:**
The How to MeCM Portal has excellent blog display functionality with modern React components, comprehensive security (CSP, DOMPurify), and performance optimizations. However, the actual blog post creation functionality is missing - the system currently only displays demo content.

**Current Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Blog reading experience: Production-ready
- ✅ Content system architecture: Well-designed hybrid approach
- ✅ Security and performance: Comprehensive implementation
- ❌ Content creation: Non-existent (demo content only)
- ❌ Database layer: Completely stubbed out

**Key Findings:**
1. The codebase is architecturally sound and ready for content management integration
2. Database layer needs implementation to enable actual content creation
3. Content creation interface is completely missing
4. No testing exists for content creation workflows (because they don't exist)

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Probability**: High - Content creation is a core requirement
- **Impact**: High - Without this, the portal cannot function as intended
- **Mitigation**: Well-designed architecture makes implementation straightforward

**Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate**: Decide on content management strategy (file-based vs CMS)
2. **Week 1**: Implement chosen content creation approach
3. **Ongoing**: Add comprehensive test coverage for content workflows
