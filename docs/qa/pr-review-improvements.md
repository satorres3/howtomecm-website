# PR Review Improvement Summary – Blog Post Creation

## Review Signals

- **Gate Status**: `CONCERNS` from the latest QA review of
  `unknown.blog-post-creation`. Key blockers: missing authoring interface,
  stubbed database layer, absent workflow tests, and undocumented process.

## BMad Full-Stack Actions

1. **Activate `team-fullstack`** to coordinate architecture, development,
   product, and QA on the remediation scope, mirroring the workflow guidance for
   cross-discipline efforts.
2. **Decide and document the content management approach** (markdown, headless
   CMS, or hybrid) before implementation, updating architecture notes and the
   story file accordingly.
3. **Implement the creation stack**: build the authoring UI, metadata
   management, publishing flow, and media handling while connecting to the
   selected persistence layer. Track progress against the “Must Have” acceptance
   criteria.
4. **Capture the new workflow** in project docs and PR notes using BMad
   checklists (story DoD, change checklist) so reviewers have traceability on
   risk mitigations and roll-back plans.

## QA Test Plan (BMad QA Team)

- **Workflow Verification**: End-to-end tests for creating drafts, publishing
  posts, editing metadata, and verifying content render on the public blog.
- **Security & Data Integrity**: Validate sanitisation, authorization, and media
  upload safety aligned with the story’s security checklist.
- **Regression Matrix**: Map acceptance criteria to Given–When–Then scenarios,
  prioritising by probability × impact per the QA agent’s risk-based charter.
- **Gate Governance**: Update the QA gate once tests pass, providing rationale
  for status changes per BMad QA guidelines.
